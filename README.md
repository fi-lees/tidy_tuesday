# Tidy Tuesday - A weekly social data project in R

\#TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge that focuses on data cleaning, wrangling and visualisation using the `R` programming language. The project was founded by **Thomas Mock** in 2018 and was born out of the the `R for Data Science` textbook and the `R4DS Online Learning Community`.

More information can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#readme.

My #TidyTuesday visualisations are shown below along with links to my code. There is also a README.md in each week's folder showing the development of the visualisation.
